# Introduction

Paladin Cloud is an extensible, Security-as-Code (SaC) platform designed to help developers and security teams reduce risks in their cloud environments. It functions as a policy management plane across multi-cloud and enterprise systems, protecting applications and data. The platform contains best practice security policies and performs continuous monitoring of cloud assets, prioritizing security violations based on severity levels to help you focus on the events that matter..

Its resource discovery capability creates an asset inventory, then evaluates security policies against each asset. Powerful visualization enables developers to quickly identify and remediate violations on a risk-adjusted basis. An auto-fix framework provides the ability to automatically respond to policy violations by taking predefined actions.

Paladin Cloud is more than a tool to manage cloud misconfiguration. It's a holistic cloud security platform that can be used for continuous monitoring and reporting across any domain.

# Extend your Coverage

Paladin Cloud's plugin-based connector architecture allows for data ingestion from multiple sources. Plugins allow you to pull data from various cloud-based enterprise systems, such as Kubernetes management, API gateways and threat intelligence systems in order to holistically manage cloud security. Examples include, Qualys Vulnerability Assessment Platform, Bitbucket, TrendMicro Deep Security, Tripwire, Venafi Certificate Management, and Redhat. You can write rules based on data collected by these plugins to get a complete picture of your cloud security posture.

# How Does It Work?

Assess -> Report -> Remediate -> Repeat

Paladin Cloud constantly assesses and monitors your cloud security posture on a near real-time basis. The platform discovers assets, evaluates policy, creates issues for policy violations, and prioritizes remediation. If an auto-fix is configured with the policy, those auto-fixes are executed when the resources fail the evaluation. Policy violations cannot not be closed manually; the issue must be fixed on the inspected asset, and then Paladin Cloud will mark it closed in the next scan.

Exceptions can be added to policy violations. Sticky exceptions (exceptions based on resource attribute matching criteria) can be added to exempt similar resources that may be created in the future. Note that exceptions should be used sparingly and only if they are aligned with corporate security guidelines.

Asset groups are a powerful way to visualize cloud security and compliance. Asset groups are created by defining one or more target resource's attribute matching criteria. For example, you could create an asset group of all running assets by defining criteria to match all EC2 instances with attribute `instancestate.name=running`. Any new EC2 instance launched after the creation of an asset group will be automatically included in the group.

In the Paladin Cloud UI, you can select the scope of the portal to a specific asset group. All the data points shown in the UI will be confined to the selected asset group. It is common practice to create asset groups per account (or subscription, project), per application, per business unit, or per environment.

Asset groups are not just for setting the scope of the data shown in the UI. The groups can be used to scope rule execution as well. Policies contain one or more rules. These rules can be configured to run against all resources or a specific asset group. The rules will evaluate all resources in the asset group configured as the scope for the rule. This provides an opportunity to write policies that are very specific to an application or organization.

A good example is when some teams would like to enforce additional tagging standards beyond the global requirements. They implement this policy with their custom rules and configure it to run only on their assets.

# Installation

Detailed installation instructions are available [here](https://github.com/PaladinCloud/CE/wiki/Paladin-Cloud-Installation-(On-AWS-Cloud))

# Usage

The installer will launch required AWS services listed in
the [installation instructions](https://github.com/PaladinCloud/CE/wiki/Paladin-Cloud-Installation-(On-AWS-Cloud)). After successful installation hit
the UI load balancer URL. Log into the application using the credentials supplied during the installation. The results
from the policy evaluation will start getting populated within 30 minutes. Trend line widgets will be populated when
there are at least two data points.

When you install Paladin Cloud, the AWS account where you install is the **source** account. Paladin Cloud can then
monitor other **target** AWS accounts. Refer to the
instructions [here](https://github.com/PaladinCloud/CE/wiki/Paladin-Cloud-Installation-(On-AWS-Cloud)) to add new accounts to Paladin Cloud. By
default the **source** account will be monitored by Paladin Cloud.

Login as Admin user and go to the Admin page from the top menu. In the Admin section, you can

* Create/Manage Policies
* Create/Manage Rules and associate Rules with Policies
* Create/Manage Asset Groups
* Create/Manage Sticky Exception
* Manage Jobs
* Create/Manage Access Roles
* Manage Paladin cloud Configurations
* See detailed instruction with screenshots on how to use the admin
  feature [here](https://github.com/paladincloud/rev1/wiki/Admin-Features)
