# Paladin Installation
## Overview
This page describes the steps to install Paladin Cloud. Paladin is built to be deployed in AWS mostly using managed
services. There are 3 major components in Paladin.
```
Paladin Rule Engine                  : CloudWatch Rules, Lambda, AWS Batch, AWS ElasticSearch

Paladin Web Application (UI & APIs)  : AWS ECS, Fargate, AWS ElasticSearch, RDS

Paladin Inventory Collector          : Cloudwatch Rules, AWS Batch, AWS ElasticSearch, RDS
```
## List of AWS resources that will be created by the installer.
* IAM Roles
* IAM Policies
* S3 Bucket
* RDS
  * MySQL 5.7.X
* Elasticsearch Service
  * Elasticsearch version 5.5
* Batch
  * Compute environments, Job Definitions and Job Queues
  * AWS Batch dynamically provisions the optimal quantity and type of compute resources (e.g., CPU or memory optimized
    instances) based on the volume and specific resource requirements of the batch jobs submitted. The number of assets
    monitored will influence the quantity and type of EC2 instances created.
* Elastic Container Registry
  * Repositories - for batch job, API and UI
* Elastic Container Service - [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/)
  * Clusters - for APIs, UI and Batch
  * Task Definitions - for APIs and UI
* Lambda Functions
  * SubmitBatchJob and SubmitRuleJob
* CloudWatch Rules
## Steps to Install

The python installer script will launch the above listed AWS resources and configure them as required for the Paladin
application. This will also build the application from the source code. The built JARs and Angular app are then deployed
in AWS ECS.

* [Prerequisites](https://github.com/PaladinCloud/CE/wiki/Installation#prerequisites)
* [Install](https://github.com/PaladinCloud/CE/wiki/Installation#install-and-deploy-paladin)
* [Limitations](https://github.com/PaladinCloud/CE/wiki/Installation#limitations)
## Prerequisites

Paladin installer is developed using Python and Terraform. For the installer to run, you will need to have below listed
dependencies installed correctly.

* Software Dependencies:
  1. Python supported version is 3.7 (There is an open issue with 3.9 and we will fix in next release)
  2. Following python packages are required.

  - docker-py (1.10)]
  - python-terraform (0.10)
  - boto3 (1.9)
  - gitpython

  3. Install the Terraform from https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.11.15/terraform_0.11.15_linux_amd64.zip

   from [here](https://github.com/PaladinCloud/CE/releases/latest)
2. Unzip the archive in a directory.
3. Go to the installer directory, once the zip file is extracted

4. Create settings/local.py file by copying from settings/default.local.py

5. Update settings/local.py file with the required values - Mandatory Changes
```
   VPC ID
   VPC CIDR
   SUBNET IDS (2 Subnets are required. Both the subnets should not be in the same AZ.)
```

6. Review other values in the local.py and update them, if needed.

7. Run the installer. (Go grab a coffee now :), it would take a while to provision the AWS resources)
```
    sudo python3 manager.py install
```

8. Installation logs will be available in the log directory

```
    tail -f log/debug.log -> To see the debug log
    tail -f log/error.log -> To see the error log

## How to setup SSL

You can secure Paladin by enabling SSL. To enable this you have to follow the below steps Configure the below variables
in local.py

* Set **ALB_PROTOCOL** to **HTTPS**
* Set **SSL_CERTIFICATE_ARN** with the ARN obtained from ACM
* Set **PALADINCLOUD_DOMAIN** if you have any else remove it.

Example 1: With self signed AWS internal URL
```
  ALB_PROTOCOL = "HTTPS" 
  SSL_CERTIFICATE_ARN = "arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:account_id:certificate/54d327ce-5f17-4a3a-9cb3-77dc10fa8371"
  PALADINCLOUD_DOMAIN = ""
```

Example 2: With external domain
```
  ALB_PROTOCOL = "HTTPS" 
  SSL_CERTIFICATE_ARN = "arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:account_id:certificate/54d327ce-5f17-4a3a-9cb3-77dc10fa8371"
  PALADINCLOUD_DOMAIN = "paladincloud.com"
```

After making the above changes, you can run install command if you are installing for first time or redeploy command if
you already installed Paladin

## Configure SSL with AWS internal URL
If you don't have any domain for Paladin and want to use AWS internal URL with https, follow the below steps

1. Create a self signed certificate for the internal URL
2. Upload it in AWS ACM (Certificate Manager) and copy ARN of that certificate
3. Update local.py to have the ALB_PROTOCOL=HTTPS and SSL_CERTIFICATE_ARN=< copied-arn-value >
4. Run sudo python manager.py install if you are installing for first time or sudo python manager.py redeploy if you
   already installed Paladin
5. Refer Example 1

## Configure SSL for specific domain
1. Create a domain for Paladin
2. Obtain SSL certificate for the domain Or Create a self signed certificate
3. Upload it in AWS ACM (Certificate Manager) and copy ARN of that certificate
4. Update local.py to have the
* **ALB_PROTOCOL**=**HTTPS**
* **SSL_CERTIFICATE_ARN**=< copied-arn-value >
* **PALADINCLOUD_DOMAIN**=< created-domain-name >

5. Run sudo python manager.py install if you are installing for first time or sudo python manager.py redeploy if you
   already installed Paladin
6. Refer Example 2

## How to scale up Paladin infrastructure ?

Paladin is capable of monitoring thousands of AWS, Azure and GCP accounts. As you add more accounts the infrastructure
may need scaled to support the increased data volume. If you are experiencing performance issues consider below:

### Upgrade RDS instance

Paladin's default instance type for RDS-MySQL is **db.t2.medium**, consider a larger instance to improve performance. To
upgrade RDS follow the below steps:

Go to local.py file
1. Set RDS_INSTANCE_TYPE to a type you require.
2. RDS_INSTANCE_TYPE = **db.t2.large**
   ```
   Run the command, sudo python3 manager.py upgrade to upgrade the server instance type
   ```

### Upgrade Elasticsearch instance

Paladin's default instance type for Elasticsearch cluster is **m4.large.elasticsearch**, consider a larger instance to
improve performance. To upgrade Elasticsearch follow the below steps:

Go to local.py file
1. Set ES_INSTANCE_TYPE to an instance type you require.
2. ES_INSTANCE_TYPE = **m4.xlarge.elasticsearch**
   ```
   Run the command, sudo python3 manager.py upgrade to upgrade the server instance type
   ```
### changing the scheduler interval for running the jobs and rules
* To change the scheduler interval, follow the below steps:
  1. Go to local.py file
  2. Set JOB_SCHEDULER_INTERVAL_IN_HOURS to the required interval in hours.
  3. JOB_SCHEDULER_INTERVAL_IN_HOURS = **6**
  4. Default value is **6** hours.

### Limitations:

AWS Fargate is not available in all AWS regions. Please visit AWS Region Table for more information on AWS regions and
services.
