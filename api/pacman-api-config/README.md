# Paladin - API - Config
This is a Spring Cloud Config service. This picks up the configuration files hosted on a repository and makes it available to all microservices which connect to it.

## How to set it up?
This microservice can run standalone and has no dependencies. But quite a few other microservices are dependent on this.
