## Configurations

* All the configurations can be done at this [file](src/config/configuration.ts).
* Check the details about each configuration
  value [here](https://github.com/PaladinCloud/CE/wiki/How-To-Configure-the-UI)

## Development & Build

### Setup the development environment
You need to set up your development environment before you can do anything.

Install [Node.jsÂ® and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if they are not already on your machine.

> Verify that you are running at least node 14.x.x and npm 6.x.x by running node -v and npm -v in a terminal/console
> window. Older versions produce errors, but newer versions are fine.

Then install the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) globally. You can install angular cli using npm:
```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Then install [Bower](https://bower.io/) globally. You can install Bower using npm:
```
npm install -g bower
```

*Great, your base setup is done!*

### Setup Web app

If you are doing this setup, means you have already cloned the repository.

Go to `webapp` folder from your terminal/console and run the following commands to install node and bower modules

```
npm install
bower install
```

Yay! you are good to start the application.

Before we proceed to running the application, one last check, look at the
application [configuration](src/config/configurations.ts) and ensure required configurations have values, optional
configuration can be skipped for now.

Check the details about each configuration value [here](https://github.com/PaladinCloud/CE/wiki/How-To-Configure-the-UI)

*Let's start the application!*

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

To change the environment: `ng serve --env={{environment}}`

`environment` in above coomand could take `dev/stg/prod`. These values belong to different environment files:
`dev` corresponds to `environment.ts`
`stg`corresponds to `environment.stg.ts`
`prod` corresponds to `environment.prod.ts`

### Build

Run `ng build --prod --aot=false` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Version your app

To version your app, you can run the below commands

```
npm run build-prod-patch // For deployment any patches, bug fixes, refactoring
npm run build-prod-minor // For any new features, without breaking backward compatibility
npm run build-prod-major // For any changes or updates without supporting backward incompatibility
```

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
